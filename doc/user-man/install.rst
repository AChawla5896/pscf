Installation
************

PSCF was designed to be used from the command line in a unix-like environment, 
and can be installed on either the linux operating system or in the Mac OS X.
There are two different ways to install a working version of PSCF in either 
operating system:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   binary
   compile-cmake
   compile-make

Installation of a precompiled binary is somewhat simpler, but does not allow
the user to modify and recompile the program. The required steps for both
procedures are described separately below, including separate discussions of
installation in different operating system environments.
