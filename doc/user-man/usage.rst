Input Files
===========

A standard SCFT calculation requires two input files::

   - A parameter file
   - An input "omega" file  

The parameter file contains both parameters required to define a physical 
system and instructions to execute a sequence of computations.  The input 
omega file contains an initial guess for the monomer chemical potential 
fields.  The parameter file is read by the main program from standard input. 
The path for the omega file is specified in the parameter file.  The format 
of the <a href="sec.php?section=Input Script&">parameter file </a> is 
described in the next page of this manual.

Command Line Usage 
==================

The syntax for executing the program pscf is thus::

   pscf < param> log

Here, "param" is the name of the parameter file, and "log" is a file to which 
we have redirected messages emitted by the program during operation.  The 
command 'pscf &lt; in', with no output log file, would instead cause these 
messages to be printed to the screen. 

Output Files
============

The program creates several types of output files. The paths to 
these files are generated by appending standard suffixes to the 
value of a string variable 'output_prefix' that must be specified 
in the parameter file. As for 'input_prefix', these files may be
placed in another directory by setting output_prefix to the path
to the desired directory, with a trailing directory separator.


Running a solution of the SCF equations for a single set of parameters 
creates the following types of output files:

========  ==================================================
 *.out    Output summary 
 *.rho    Monomer concentration fields 
 *.omega  Monomer chemical potential fields 
 *.waves  Information about plane waves and basis functions 
========  ==================================================

The same file format is used for rho and omega output files, both of 
which describe fields. Each field file contains a lists of coefficients 
of symmetry adapted basis functions, in which each such basis function 
is a sum of plane waves that are related by symmetry. The format, and 
the use of symmetry adapted basis functions to represent fields, is
described in more detail 
<a href="sec.php?section=Field Files&">here</a>.
