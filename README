 PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 Copyright (2007-2016) Regents of the University of Minnesota
 Contact: David Morse, morse012@umn.edu

 PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
 self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
 by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
 linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents.

I. Directory Structure

src/                          - Fortran 90 source files
src/build                     - - directory containing Makefile

II. Dependencies

The program depends upon the FFTW fast Fourier transform library
and the LAPACK linear algebra library.  The program can use either 
version 2 or version 3 of the FFTW library.  You will need to 
install both LAPACK and FFTW before attempting to compile the 
program.

III. Compiling and Linking

Instructions for compiling the program from source, as well as various
ways to install precompiled executables, are discussed in the file 

   doc/sphinx/install.rst

An annotated list of source files is provided in the file src/SRC_FILES. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
IV. Preprocessor

Several of the fortran *.f source files have been created using a 
python preprocessor from corresponding files that end with the suffix
*.fp.f. This preprocessor script, named "Forpedo", is included with the 
distribution.  The only *.f files that are now built in this way are:
src/build/pscf_pd.f src/build/scf_mod.f and src/build/iterate_mod.f
Because coies of these three files are included with this distribution, 
it is not necessary for you to run the preprocessor in order to compile 
the program. Before modifying any of the fortran source files, however, 
please read the discussion of the preprocessor near the end of the file 
src/SRC_FILES.
