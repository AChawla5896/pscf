PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
Copyright (2002-2016) Regents of the University of Minnesota

PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents.

Dependencies:

The PSCF executable links to a FFTW fast Fourier transform library 
and a LAPACK linear algebra library. The build system also depends 
on python. These packages must be installed before attempting to 
compile the program from source.

User Documentation:

A web user manual is avalaible at:

   https://pscf.readthedocs.io

Instructions for compiling the program from source, as well as various
ways to install precompiled executables, are given in the user manual.

The source files for the user manual are text files that are stored in 
the doc/user-man directory. The relevant files have file extension .rst. 

Developer Documentation:

A local copy of the developer API documentation, which includes 
documentation for all modules, subroutines and public variables, may 
be regenerated by following instructions given in the file doc/README. 
The resulting .html page are installed in doc/devel-man.

An annotated list of source files is given in the file src/README. 
Before modifying any fortran files, see the note at the end of that 
file regarding the use of a python preprocessor script to generate 
some source files.
