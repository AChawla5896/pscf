 PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 Copyright (2007-2016) Regents of the University of Minnesota
 Contact: David Morse, morse012@umn.edu

 PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
 self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
 by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
 linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents.

 Dependencies:

 PSCF depends upon the FFTW fast Fourier transform library and the 
 LAPACK linear algebra library.  These packages must be installed 
 before attempting to compile the program from source. Neither of
 these packages is needed to use a precompiled binary executable, 
 which is self-contained.

Documentation

The source files for a user manual are easily readable text files that 
are stored in the doc/user-man directory, The resulting web pages are 
also available online at the site:

   https://pscf.readthedocs.org

Instructions for compiling the program from source, as well as various
ways to install precompiled executables, are discussed in the file 

   doc/sphinx/install.rst

and in the corresponding section of the web user manual. 

Developer API documentation may be generated by following the 
instructions given in the file doc/README, which are repeated in the
user manual. The resulting .html page are installed in doc/devel-man.

Preprocessor Script

Several of the fortran *.f source files have been created using a 
python preprocessor from corresponding files that end with the suffix
*.fp.f. This preprocessor script, named "Forpedo", is included with the 
distribution.  Before modifying any of the fortran source files, please 
read the discussion of the preprocessor near the end of the file 
src/SRC_FILES.
