 PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 Copyright (2007) Regents of the University of Minnesota
 email: morse012@umn.edu

 PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
 self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
 by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
 linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents.

I. Directory Structure

src/                          - Fortran 90 source files
src/build                     - - directory containing Makefile
examples/                     - usage examples, with input files
doc/                          - documentation files
doc/api                       - - auto-generated api documentation
tools/                        - Tools for processing output and source
tools/matlab                  - - matlab m-files for visualization
tools/python                  - - python scripts for data analysis
tools/python/preprocess-0.6.1   - Forpedo preprocessor script

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
II. Dependencies

The program depends upon the FFTW fast Fourier transform library
and the LAPACK linear algebra library.  The program can use either 
version 2 or version 3 of the FFTW library.  You will need to 
install both LAPACK and FFTW before attempting to compile the 
program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
III. Compiling and Linking

The program must be compiled from source. The source is standard
Fortran 90, and has been tested with the Intel and Portland Group 
Fortran 90 compilers in a linux environment.

A Makefile for compiling on a linux machine is located in 
subdirectory src/build. To compile the code, after installing the
required FFTW and LAPACK libraries, you will generally have to cd 
to src/build, change the values of various macro variables in this 
Makefile to values appropriate to your system, and issue the 
command 'make pscf' from within src/build.  

More detailed instructions for editing the Makefile and compiling 
are provided in the file src/build/INSTALL, and in comments in the 
file src/build/Makefile.

An annotated list of source files is provided in the file src/SRC_FILES.

IV. Preprocessor

Several of the fortran *.f source files have been created using a 
python preprocessor from corresponding files that end with the suffix
*.fp.f. This preprocessor script, named "Forpedo", is included with the 
distribution.  The only *.f files that are now built in this way are:
src/build/pscf_pd.f src/build/scf_mod.f and src/build/iterate_mod.f
Because coies of these three files are included with this distribution, 
it is not necessary for you to run the preprocessor in order to compile 
the program. Before modifying any of the fortran source files, however, 
please read the discussion of the preprocessor near the end of the file 
src/SRC_FILES.
