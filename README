 PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 Copyright (2007-2016) Regents of the University of Minnesota

 PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
 self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
 by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
 linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents.

 Dependencies:

 PSCF depends upon the FFTW fast Fourier transform library and the 
 LAPACK linear algebra library.  These packages must be installed 
 before attempting to compile the program from source.

 User Documentation:

 A web user manual is avalaible at:

    https://pscf.readthedocs.org

 Instructions for compiling the program from source, as well as various
 ways to install precompiled executables, are discussed in the user manual.

 The source files for the user manual are text files that are stored in 
 the doc/user-man directory. The relevant files have file extension .rst. 
 Installation instructions are given in doc/sphinx/install.rst

 Developer Documentation:

 Developer API documentation may be generated by following instructions 
 given in the file doc/README. The resulting .html page are installed in 
 doc/devel-man.
