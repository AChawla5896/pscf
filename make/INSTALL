 PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 Copyright (2007) David C. Morse

 PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
 self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
 by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
 linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents. 

 This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation. A copy of this license is included in

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PSCF can be compiled either using the unix make utility, using the
Makefile that is provided in this directory, or using cmake to build
a more complex makefile. 

See the file doc/user-man/compile.rst, or the corresponding page in
the web user manual, for instructions for compiling using make, and
doc/user-man/compile-cmake.rst for instructions to compile using 
cmake. For the impatient, brief instructions are:

1. Install the open source LAPACK linear algebra library and the 
FFTW fast fourier transform library. 

2. Change directory (cd) to the pscf/make directory (i.e., this 
directory) and copy the file Makefile_r to Makefile, by entering

>  cp Makefile_r Makefile

Explanation: The file Makefile_r is a default version of the Makefile
that is stored in the git repository. Users can modify the copy named
Makefile, but should generally avoid modifying Makefile_r.

3. Edit the Makefile as needed, following comments given in the Makefile
and in the user manual.

4. To compile, issue the command:

   > make pscf

from within the build directory.  This will fill the build 
directory with *.o and *.mod files and install an executable file
at $(BIN)/$(EXE).
      
5. If desired, to remove all of the generated *.o and *.mod files
from the build directory and the executable file, enter:

   > make clean

6. NOTE: Before modifying any of the source files, read the 
discussion at the end of the src/SRC_FILES file regarding the use 
of a python preprocessor script (FORPEDO) to automatically generate 
some fortran files from preprocessor input files.
